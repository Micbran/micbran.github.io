The addon behaves much like a mod in a typical game, adding or changing content that appears in the game. In the case of Anguished, it adds a new playable "class" (a set of abilities) for the player to play as.</p>

          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">The class itself contains roughly 36 uniquely coded "talents" (aka abilities) with a balance between inflicting debuffs (damage and impairment), doing direct damage, and defense. My goal was to create a sort of hybrid caster which I did ultimately succeed at. The first thing I realized when I started this project was that I didn't know Lua (that was thankfully quickly rectified as Lua is very easy to learn) and the second thing I realized is that I didn't know how the engine (TEngine-4) worked at all. Needless to say, much of the project was trial and error and a whole lot of looking at the game's original code. Overall, the project came out well, people had said that it was "on the weak side, and a little boring" but that was better than "unplayable and trash." This was more or less my first design endeavor and I think it went better than expected -- it also taught me how to read code that someone else had written, something that you don't often do as a CS student.</p>
